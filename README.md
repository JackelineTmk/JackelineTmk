# Hi there! 👋 I'm Jackeline

I'm an Electrical Engineering undergraduate student at **UFSCar** with
interest in **software development** and technology.

I started programming in high school through a **Technical Degree in Information
Technology at ETEC**, where I built a solid foundation in programming and IT
concepts.

## 💻 Technical Background

During high school, I worked with:
- SQL
- C++
- Java
- Pascal
- Computer Networks
- Excel
- HTML & CSS

At university, I expanded my skills through a **robotics extension project**,
where I worked with:
- Python
- Git & GitHub
- Linux

In this project, I also developed important soft skills, acting as an **area
manager** and later as **Vice President**, which helped me grow in leadership,
teamwork, and communication.

## 📚 Continuous Learning

In addition to academic projects, I’ve been expanding my knowledge through
online courses, especially in:
- HTML / CSS
- JavaScript
- Node.js

I’m always studying to improve my technical skills, explore new technologies,
and gain practical experience in development.

## 🎯 Current Goal

I am currently looking for an **internship in software development**, where I
can:
- Apply what I’ve learned
- Learn from real-world projects
- Grow both technically and professionally

## 🗂 About This Profile

Here you’ll find:
- High school technical projects
- Academic and learning projects
- Experiments and study repositories

Some projects reflect my learning process at different stages — and that’s
intentional 🙂
